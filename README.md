# Motion-Detector
I programmed a functional python application utilizing the OpenCV library to manipulate the built-in webcam to detect any captured motion and export obtained time intervals for observed motion to a CSV file using the pandas library for further analysis. Furthermore, I decided to visualize the data using the Bokeh library to generate an interactive graph on the web browser to make it more compelling.
